# Genshin Wish Calculator

A browser-based planning tool for Genshin Impact's wish system — plan your pulls across upcoming patches and see how your saved-up primogems/starglitter/wishes hold up under best, worst, and mixed-luck scenarios.

No build step, no backend — static HTML/CSS/JS.

## Features

- Priority-ordered pull planning (Hard Lock / One Shot / Optional targets)
- Patch-by-patch income modeling (average or custom per-patch income, Welkin/Battle Pass)
- Best / Worst / mixed-outcome scenario breakdowns with pity, guarantee, and Capture Radiance handling
- Save/export/import your plan as JSON
- PNG export of the scenario summary
- Mobile-friendly layout
